## Output

The crawler shows progress during execution with a dot (.) for each page without errors and a cross (Ã—) for pages with broken links. At the end, it displays a table summarizing all broken links found.

## Output Format

The program will output a list of pages and any broken links they contain, along with the reason why the link is considered broken.
